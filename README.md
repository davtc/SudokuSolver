# Sudoku Solver
## Summary
The aim of this project is to create a Sudoku solver with several different methods to input the Sudoku using a front-end web application.
- Manually enter the numbers into a Sudoku grid.
- Upload an image of a Sudoku and have the application detect and reflect it to a front end.
- Enter a URL containing a Sudoku and automatically take a screenshot of the website and reflect the detected puzzle into the front end.

After the puzzle is input, the user can then press a button to solve the Sudoku automatically by sending a request to the back end. Users will also be able to save and load Sudoku puzzles from a database using SQLite.
